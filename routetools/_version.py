"""Auto-generated fallback version file for setuptools_scm.

This file will be overwritten by setuptools_scm during builds if git metadata
is available. Having this file present ensures that tools which read the
package (like `uv` when generating the lockfile) can discover a concrete
version even when running in environments without git metadata.
